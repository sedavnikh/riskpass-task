# Task
A simple task for candidates who wish to join the RiskPass team:

Please, refactor the code so you feel comfortable with your refactorings.

Please, submit a pull request with your changes. Try spend as less time as possible, do only what you think is really important to make the code better. Probably there are many issues, but only a few of them worth changing. We would like to see what attracts your attention.

Please share your ideas on what else can be done with the code, what you might do later on.
